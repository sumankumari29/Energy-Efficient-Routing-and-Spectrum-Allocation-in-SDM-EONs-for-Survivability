# Energy-Efficient Fragmentation-Aware Routing Modulation Spectrum and Core Allocation Algorithms for Survivable Space Division Multiplexed Elastic Optical Networks

## Project Overview

The project "Energy-Efficient Fragmentation-Aware Routing Modulation Spectrum and Core Allocation Algorithms for Survivable Space Division Multiplexed Elastic Optical Networks" addresses critical challenges in the field of optical networking. With the increasing demand for high-capacity data transmission, Space Division Multiplexed Elastic Optical Networks (SDM-EONs) offer a promising solution. This project focuses on improving the efficiency, energy management, and survivability of SDM-EONs through the development and implementation of innovative algorithms.

## Features

- **Energy-Efficient Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to minimize energy consumption while maintaining high network performance.
- **Fragmentation-Aware Techniques**: Strategies to manage spectrum fragmentation, optimizing resource usage and reducing blocking.
- **Core Allocation**: Advanced algorithms for effective core allocation to increase the number of requests served.
- **Survivability**: Ensures network resilience and reliability by incorporating survivability mechanisms.
